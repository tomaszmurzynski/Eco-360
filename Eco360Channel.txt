Tell us what your idea is. 

	Creating a series of Virtual Reality experiences for programmers education, 
	with use video 360 degrees and subtitles for better understanding code by 
	the user of the application. Preparing scenes and sets of tools in VR needs for 
	user tasks. Creating a user base with experience line and tips directions for 
	evolution and development. I wish to use 5G technology for minimalize time for 
	the necessary server's answer and enjoyable using application without lags. 

Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 

	Hard work and good thinking it' my role for executing any quest. Step by step. Part by part.

Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor,
and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life.

	I do not know yet how but it's a lot of possibilities for use video 360 degrees, 
	I want to know first what I can do or create with Google cloud and use this knowledge 
	to decide on how to use this on Device ML technology.

The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where
you plan on going, which should include: 

	I want to be a Software Engineer and my role is taking the experience with creating an application from a beginner to end

(1) any potential sample code you’ve already written:

	https://github.com/tomaszmurzynski/Eco/tree/CSharp/CSharp, 

(2) a list of the ways you could use Google’s help,

	It's my first project with a development Google-like cloud, I just want to know 
	how to use any cloud functionality. Ok, I know something about it from my university, but this just knowledge all for beginners, 
	how to create with Google an app engine in Java, I learned yesterday. 
	Hey, it's similar to my experience from before. Quick everything is done, 
	it's my first feeling and it's a lot of documentation is available on Google.

Tell us about you. 

	It's a long story about me. Just from my youngest, I being programming.
	I have 8 or 9 years old when I write my first code in basic. And I cried 
	with few newspapers about Commodore 64. My first program is like a clock 
	just displays in one of the corners of the screen. Now I have 35 years old 
	and I just love programming, new technology and any big ideas for a better 
	future. 

	Link to another project https://gitlab.com/tomasz.murzynski/dangeoneer
	Based on a card game Dangeonner just for the experience and rememberer for 
	coding after Java course. I just try with Test Driven Development for myself.
